I made this collection of playgrounds in the process of learning object oriented design course, so that I can understand concepts better in Swift instead of Java (which instructor used).

I suddenly finish course and realize, that I want to learn more, bridge basics I learnet to practice in Swift and keep this playgrounds updated. I will appreciate any help to made this collection complete and comprehensible.


# Structure

I want to keep each playground short and self-explained. Motivation and basic implementation in playground with pattern name, than more native and specific implementations in additional playgrounds named by convention "Pattern name - specific".
