# Swift design playgrounds

I made this collection of playgrounds in the process of learning object oriented design course, so that I can understand concepts better in Swift instead of Java (which instructor used).

I suddenly finish course and realize, that I want to learn more, bridge basics I learnet to practice in Swift and keep this playgrounds updated. I will appreciate any help to made this collection complete and comprehensible.

Moreover I realize that Swift is an opportunity to reevalute some classical OO design patterns in light of functional approach. I will keep updating this collection updated on my way to learn what it practically means.


# Structure

I want to keep each playground resonable short and self explained. I keep "motivation" section and basic implementation in a playground file with pattern name, than more native for Swift or specific variants in additional playgrounds named by convention "Pattern name - Specific".  

**State Machine** is the best example so far.

"The problem is, about 1/3 to 1/2 of them were basically cover-ups for deficiencies in C++ that don't exist in other languages. Although I'm not a huge Perl fan anymore, I have to admit the Perl community caught on to this first (or at least funniest). They pointed out that many of these so-called patterns were actually an implementation of Functional Programming in C++. 

The Visitor, for instance, is just a class wrapper for a function with some accumulator variables, something that's achieved far more cleanly with, say, the map() function in higher-level languages. Iterator is a poor man's Visitor. The Strategy pattern is beautiful on the surface, but Strategy objects are typically stateless, which means they're really just first-order functions in disguise. (If they have state, then they're Closures in disguise.) Etc. You either get this, because you've done functional programming before, or you don't, in which case I sound like I'm a babbling idiot, so I guess I'll wrap it up."
