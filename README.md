I made this collection of playgounds in the process of learning object oriented design cousrse, so that I can understand concepts better in Swift instead of Java (which instructor used).

I suddenly finish course and relize, that I want to learn more, bridge basics to real practice and keep this playgrounds updated. I will appriciate any help to made this collection complete and comprehensible.


# Structure

I want to keep each playground short and self-explained. Motivation and basic implementation in playgound with patern name, than more native and specific implementations in additional playgorunds named by convention "Pattern name - specific".
